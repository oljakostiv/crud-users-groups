# Introduction

PERN (postgres, express, react, node) is a framework that allows
developers interested in these technologies to get up
and running with a minimum of fuss. It's still a work in progress, 
but it has the following pieces:

* CRUD functionality (for users and groups)
* node/express backend for API calls
* postgres database with minimal schema to demonstrate functionality
* React/Redux frontend to demonstrate simple functionality
* containerize with Docker
* Instructions on how to set everything up
